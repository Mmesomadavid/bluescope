              Mining is critical to securing the minerals essential for everyday life and essential to be able to build
              renewable energy projects. The mining industry produces the primary products required for the generation,
              distribution and delivery of renewable energy. The first step in the supply chain to create solar panels
              and wind turbines and EV batteries begins with mining companies like Blue Scope, Atlas and Roy Hill.

              activity. Over the last seven years alone, Blue Scope has contributed well in excess of $300 million in
              royalties to these communities, as well as other significant investments in health, education, arts and

              Part of these efforts are that miners are required to consult and reach agreement with the Traditional

              proceed.

                Mining is by far Australia's largest export industry. Over the past decade, the industry contributed
                $2.4 trillion in resources export revenue. While the vast majority of minerals extracted in Australia
                are exported, the benefits are retained in Australia.
